            <p  class="fs-5 paragraph-class">The One Year Regular Classroom Course is specially designed for the students who have passed class XI and are moving to class XII. Special care has been taken in formulating the courseware for this program keeping in mind the vast syllabus of the UPSC NDA and of School/Board Examinations.

            <br>The students of class XII passed/droppers can also opt for our One Year Integrated Classroom course for the preparation of UPSC NDA and Other competitive Exam.

            <br>This course starts around mid-April every year. This one year is quite challenging for students. Coupled with periodic assessments and tricky tests, a student is enabled to face all the tough Exams ahead.

            <br>This One Year Program speeds up the training process of a student. We aim to provide individual attention so that even average students are properly trained and become competent and confident enough to crack the difficult exam.

            <br>The proven student selection track record has made Chandigarh Defence Academy believe that with consistent hard work, dedication and proper guidance anyone can crack the Engineering and Medical Entrance Exams.

            <br>NOTE: - Provision to join training even for those students who missed the 11TH Class in the Academy in their previous year but prepared for NDA +JEE (Main Advance) in some other institute or with individual teachers or on his/her own or did not prepare for NDA+ JEE (Main Advance) and other competitive examination.


            <br>â€¢ The Test Series turns out to be quite helpful for students in maintaining and analyzing preparation level of NDA +JEE (Main) even after completion of Course</p>
